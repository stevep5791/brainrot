### Admin Credentials
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** BrainRotAdmin2024!
- **URL:** https://brainrot.smartechconstruction.com/admin/

### GitHub Repository
- **URL:** https://github.com/stevep5791/brainrot
- Git initialized on Beauty at `/var/www/brainrot/`
- Can push changes directly from Beauty

## What Still Needs Testing/Completion

### For Tomorrow's Demo
1. **Test full submission flow** - Submit text + image + categories → appears in admin
2. **Test user registration** - New user signs up → can submit with account linked
3. **Test admin panel** - Login as admin → view submissions → search → view detail
4. **Hard refresh browsers** - Clear cache to see new Classic Federal theme

### Known Issues to Address
1. Browser cache may still show old purple theme - use Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh
2. uploads/ directory permissions may need adjustment for file uploads

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Step
Test the full end-to-end flow:
1. Go to https://brainrot.smartechconstruction.com/
2. Register a new account
3. Submit brain rot content (text + image)
4. Login to admin panel
5. Verify submission appears with user linked

### Subsequent Steps
1. Commit latest changes to GitHub
2. Create test data for demo
3. Start building "Better World Browser" Electron app

### Commands to Run
```bash
# On Beauty - test database
mysql -u brainrot_user -p'BrainRot2024!' brainrot_submissions -e "SELECT * FROM users; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions;"

# Commit changes
cd /var/www/brainrot && git add -A && git commit -m "Add auth system and admin panel" && git push
```

## Important Context

### Future Vision: "Better World Browser"
Discussed building an Electron app that:
- Wraps Facebook/social media in custom browser
- Students login to brainrot, then browse social media
- "Report Brain Rot" buttons injected into posts (like Waze hazard reports)
- Data flows to brainrot server for ML training
- Eventually: AI warns users about brain rot content in real-time
- Cross-platform: Mac/Windows/Linux, potentially mobile

### Architecture Notes
- Beast (10.0.100.110) - Main dev server, has gh CLI
- Beauty (10.0.100.111) - Brainrot production server
- code-intelligence tools now installed on both servers
